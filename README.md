# ikeda_map
Simple python implementation of the Ikeda map. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikeda_map for more information about the Ikeda map

Run ikeda.py and you will be prompted to enter in the number of points for your initial random array of coordinates, the number of iterations to apply the Ikeda map and the u parameter. This will create a screen showing two graphs with the inital configuration of points next to the final configuration.
